I have completed two major technical internships, one in Machine Learning and one in Generative AI.

1.My first internship was at Silicon Interfaces, a semiconductor and chip design company. I worked there as a Machine Learning Intern. My primary task was to build a fault simulation and fault detection system for digital circuits, specifically for stuck-at faults in chip design.For this project, I built an artificial neural network (feed-forward deep learning model) using Python. The model required careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, and optimization algorithms. I worked deeply with the mathematics of training neural networks, including gradient descent, loss minimization, and activation functions. The final trained model achieved approximately 91 percent accuracy in predicting faults, which was considered strong for this domain.
This internship gave me a strong foundation in how machine learning models are trained and optimized in real engineering environments, especially where data quality and noise are significant challenges.

2.My second internship was at L&T Technology Services (LTTS), where I worked in the Generative AI team. Here, I worked on advanced AI systems involving large language models, document intelligence, image understanding, and automation.
One of my major contributions at LTTS was building a foundational GenAI model that could extract structured information from unstructured data sources such as customer emails, scanned documents, handwritten labels, invoices, and even images like PCB boards. This system became the base of DocuSnap, a product that automated document processing workflows.
I solved more than eight real-world GenAI use cases for different teams inside LTTS. These included extracting data from emails, PDFs, handwritten notes, and images, classifying and routing documents, and building automated pipelines using LLMs and AI agents.
My work was showcased to the Nordic region leadership of L&T Technology Services, and my model was used as an example of the kind of AI solutions LTTS could offer to enterprise clients. The system I built began to be marketed internally as a solution capability of the company. Based on my performance, I received a full-time offer from the organization.
I also built an agentic AI system that could take a goal, break it into multiple steps, and use different tools and models to complete complex tasks automatically. This agentic framework was also used inside the DocuSnap and Answer Sheet Evaluation systems.
